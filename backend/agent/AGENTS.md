# AGENTS.md

Rules and conventions for AI assistants and contributors working on foolrs.

## Overview

foolrs is a **multi-provider AI agent CLI** written in Rust. It connects to
LLM providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, AWS Bedrock, Google Vertex AI), orchestrates
built-in tools (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob, Spawn), supports MCP
servers, skills, hooks, and long-term memory. It also exposes a JSON stream
protocol for host integration (e.g. Electron-based AionUI).

Tech stack: Rust 2021 edition, stable toolchain, Cargo workspace under `crates/`.

## Crate Map

Dependencies flow **downward** — never introduce circular or upward references.

| Layer  | Crate            | Responsibility                                                                                              |

| Top    | `aion-cli`       | CLI binary entry point                                                                                      |

When adding new functionality, place it in the **lowest crate where it
semantically belongs**. Don't create a new crate just for one shared function.
Run `cargo metadata` to verify dependency changes fit the graph.

## Build & Test

```bash
cargo build            # Build
cargo test             # Run all tests
cargo clippy           # Lint
cargo fmt --all        # Format (CI enforces this)
```

**Pushing code: always use `just push` instead of `git push`.**
It runs fmt → clippy → test before pushing, preventing CI failures.
Supports the same arguments as `git push` (e.g. `just push -u origin branch`).

## Code Standards

After implementation and before staging or committing, perform a self-check
against this section. Do not rely on tests or review to catch style drift.

### Required Checks

- `cargo clippy` must pass without warnings
- `cargo fmt` must pass without diffs
- Comments in English, commit messages in English
- Error handling:
  - `thiserror` for public API error types (structured, matchable)
  - `anyhow` for internal/application-level error propagation
  - Never silently swallow errors; never `unwrap()` in production code
    unless the invariant is proven and commented

### Visibility & Exports

- After finishing a task, explicitly review visibility for any new or modified
  functions, types, modules, constants, configuration items, events, protocol
  entries, or APIs. Confirm they really need to be externally exposed.
- Items that are not used across modules, crates, processes, or packages should
  remain private or file/module-scoped. Do not expose them just for convenience.
- When exposure is necessary, choose the narrowest suitable scope. In Rust,
  prefer restricted visibility such as `pub(crate)`, `pub(super)`, or
  `pub(in ...)` over bare `pub`.
- Public interfaces must have clear callers, stability expectations, and
  boundary semantics. If an export exists only for tests, temporary wiring, or
  bypassing a module boundary, redesign it or use a narrower entry point.

### Rust

- Do not write business logic in `mod.rs` or `lib.rs`. These files are only for
  module visibility declarations and re-exports.
- Structs with many fields should be grouped by responsibility first. Keep
  related runtime state, configuration, and dependencies together instead of
  ordering fields by when they were added or temporarily used.
- Prefer importing any type, function, trait, constant, or value path that is
  outside the current `mod` with `use`, then reference it by local name. If a
  usage path contains two or more `::` segments (for example,
  `session::SessionManager::new` or `pre_message::PreMessageOutcome::Stop`),
  import it so the use site has at most one `::`.
- The import rule applies to type positions, function calls, value paths, and
  turbofish syntax. Conventional exceptions may remain qualified: macros such
  as `tracing::info!`, `tokio::select!`, and `anyhow::bail!`; attribute macros
  such as `#[tokio::main]`; `anyhow::Result` when needed to avoid conflicts
  with standard names; and standard module idioms such as `env::current_dir` or
  `io::stdin`.
- Rust test submodules must be extracted into same-directory `*_test.rs` files.
  The source file should keep only the test mount, for example:
  `#[cfg(test)]` plus `#[path = "..._test.rs"] mod ..._test;`.

### Agent Integration

- AionCLI is the built-in SDK/library integration path. Do not model it as an
  external agent subprocess when changing Aion host integration code.
- For Claude Code, Codex, or other external agent integrations, first review
  the ACP protocol, subprocess lifecycle, logging, and security boundaries.

## Logging

When changing a critical path, explicitly evaluate whether logs are needed for development diagnosis and production troubleshooting. Add structured logs with appropriate levels:

- `debug` for detailed, high-frequency internal flow that helps verify behavior and diagnose issues in development
- `info` for low-volume lifecycle boundaries useful in production
- `warn` for malformed or unexpected data that is safely handled
- `error` for contract violations or failed operations

Production-visible logs must not include sensitive payloads such as prompts, tool input/output, file contents, command bodies, tokens, secrets, or raw provider requests/responses. If such payloads are needed for local debugging, they must be behind explicit development-only guards and never enabled by default.

## File Organization

- Each module (`.rs` file) follows the **single responsibility principle** —
  one clear purpose per file
- Keep files under 1000 lines; extract sub-modules when approaching the limit
- Organize by domain responsibility, not by type

## Architecture Principles

### No Hardcoded Provider Quirks

**This is the single most important rule for this codebase.**

Handle provider differences through the **`ProviderCompat` configuration
layer**, not through hardcoded conditionals.

```rust
// WRONG: hardcoded provider detection
if self.base_url.contains("api.openai.com") {
    body["max_completion_tokens"] = json!(max_tokens);
}

// CORRECT: read from compat config
let field = self.compat.max_tokens_field.as_deref().unwrap_or("max_tokens");
body[field] = json!(request.max_tokens);
```

If you need a new compat behavior:

1. Add an `Option<T>` field to `ProviderCompat`
2. Set its default in the appropriate preset function (e.g. `openai_defaults()`)
3. Use it in provider code via `self.compat.field_name`

All providers implement the `LlmProvider` trait. The engine sees only
provider-neutral types (`LlmRequest`, `LlmEvent`, `Message`, `ContentBlock`).
Format conversion happens inside each provider's `build_messages()` /
`build_request_body()`.

> setup, auth, aliases, and profile inheritance.

### Centralize Platform Differences

Any platform-specific behavior (paths, permissions, shell commands, line
endings, etc.) must be wrapped in a single centralized function. All call
sites use that function — never scatter raw platform detection across
multiple crates or modules. See [Cross-Platform](#cross-platform) for
concrete rules.

### No Duplicate Code Across Crates

If multiple crates need the same functionality, extract it to the
appropriate existing crate in the dependency graph — don't copy-paste
or reimplement. Choose the extraction target based on where it
semantically belongs and where it minimizes dependency changes.

## Cross-Platform

CI runs on macOS, Linux, **and Windows**. Local dev can only test the
current platform's `#[cfg(...)]` code — other platform branches are
verified by CI alone.

### Paths

- Never hardcode platform paths (`/tmp/...`, `C:\...`) in production code.
  Use `Path::join()`, `dirs::config_dir()`, `tempfile::tempdir()`, etc.
- In tests, hardcoded Unix paths (`Path::new("/foo/...")`) are fine for
  pure string operations (join, display) or nonexistent-path error handling.
  Only add `#[cfg(unix)]` / `#[cfg(windows)]` variants when the path is
  passed to `is_absolute()`, `validate_memory_path()`, or similar
  platform-sensitive checks.
- Use `std::path::Component::Normal` (not byte length) when checking
  path depth — prefix/root components differ across platforms.

### Shell Execution

- All shell invocations must go through `aion_config::shell` module
  (`shell_command()` or `shell_command_builder()`).
- Never call `Command::new("sh")`, `Command::new("bash")`, or
  `Command::new("cmd")` directly — these are platform-specific.
- External CLI tools that differ across platforms (e.g. `grep` vs
  `findstr`) must use `cfg!(windows)` branches or equivalent
  platform-aware selection.

## Test Organization

| Location                                                                                                              | What goes there                        |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Same-directory `*_test.rs` mounted from each `.rs` file with `#[cfg(test)]` + `#[path = "..._test.rs"] mod ..._test;` | Unit tests for that module's internals |
| `crates/<crate>/tests/`                                                                                               | Integration tests for that crate       |

Unit tests target internal logic and code paths.
Integration tests target functional requirements and public API —
write them from the spec, not from reading the implementation.

Every test must verify a meaningful behavior or edge case.
No trivial tests that just assert the happy path without checking boundaries,
error conditions, or non-obvious logic.
