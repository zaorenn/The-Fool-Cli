# MCP (Model Context Protocol) Integration

## Overview

MCP allows the agent to connect to external tool servers, extending beyond the 7 built-in tools to the entire MCP server ecosystem.

## Configuring MCP Servers

Declare MCP servers in the config file:

```toml
# Stdio transport: launch a local subprocess
[mcp.servers.filesystem]
transport = "stdio"
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/Users/me/project"]

[mcp.servers.github]
transport = "stdio"
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"]
env = { GITHUB_TOKEN = "ghp_xxx" }
startup_timeout_ms = 30000

# SSE transport: connect to a remote SSE server
[mcp.servers.database]
transport = "sse"
url = "http://localhost:3001/sse"

# Streamable HTTP transport: HTTP POST communication
[mcp.servers.remote-tools]
transport = "streamable-http"
url = "https://tools.example.com/mcp"
headers = { Authorization = "Bearer xxx" }
```

## Transport Types

| Transport         | Description                                           | Use Case                     |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `stdio`           | Launch local subprocess, communicate via stdin/stdout | Local MCP servers (npx, uvx) |
| `sse`             | GET for SSE event stream, POST for requests           | Remote MCP servers           |
| `streamable-http` | HTTP POST, supports SSE streaming responses           | Remote MCP servers           |

## Startup Timeout

Configured MCP servers are connected concurrently during startup. Each server
has a startup timeout covering transport connection, `initialize`, and
`tools/list`. The default is `30000` milliseconds.

```toml
[mcp.servers.slow-tools]
transport = "stdio"
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "slow-mcp-server"]
startup_timeout_ms = 60000
```

Increase `startup_timeout_ms` for servers that need extra time for first-run
setup, package downloads, remote authentication, or slow network handshakes.

## Deferred Loading

MCP tools can be registered as "deferred" — their full schema is not loaded into the system prompt at startup, reducing initial token usage. The LLM discovers deferred tools via the `ToolSearch` tool when needed.

```toml
[mcp.servers.large-toolset]
transport = "stdio"
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "my-mcp-server"]
deferred = true    # Don't load tool schemas at startup
```

| `deferred`                           | Behavior                                                     |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `false` (default for config servers) | Tool schemas included in system prompt at startup            |
| `true`                               | Tools registered but schemas loaded on-demand via ToolSearch |

Use `deferred = true` for MCP servers with many tools to keep the initial system prompt small.

## Tool Naming

- MCP tool names are used directly when there's no conflict
- On conflict with built-in or other MCP tools, names are auto-prefixed: `mcp__{server}__{tool}`

## Startup Flow

1. Connect to all configured MCP servers
2. Perform MCP protocol handshake (`initialize`) for each server
3. Discover available tools (`tools/list`)
4. Register tools in the tool registry — the agent uses them like built-in tools
5. Gracefully close all connections on exit
