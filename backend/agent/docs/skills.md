# Skills

Skills are named prompt snippets that the agent can invoke on demand. They
let you package reusable instructions, workflows, or tool sequences into a
single callable name.

## Overview

A skill is a Markdown file with a YAML front matter header. When the agent
invokes a skill, it:

1. Resolves the skill by name from the loaded skill list
2. Substitutes variables (`$ARGUMENTS`, `$0`, `${FOOLRS_SKILL_DIR}`)
3. Expands any shell commands (`` !`cmd` `` syntax)
4. Returns the processed text as the skill's output

## Directory Structure

Skills are loaded from the following locations, in priority order (first match
wins for duplicate names):

| Priority | Path                          | Description                                      |
| -------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| 1        | `.foolrs/skills/`             | Project-local skills (checked-in with the repo)  |
| 2        | `<CONFIG_DIR>/foolrs/skills/` | User-global skills (see below)                   |
| 3        | `.foolrs/commands/`           | Legacy flat `.md` files (backward compatibility) |

> **`<CONFIG_DIR>` by platform:**
>
> - **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/`
> - **Linux:** `~/.config/` (or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`)
> - **Windows:** `C:\Users\<USER>\AppData\Roaming\`
>
> Run `foolrs skills path` to see the actual paths on your machine.

Each skill is either a single `SKILL.md` file inside a named subdirectory, or
a flat `.md` file in a `commands/` directory:

```
.foolrs/skills/
├── deploy/
│   └── SKILL.md          # invoked as "deploy"
├── review-pr/
│   └── SKILL.md          # invoked as "review-pr"
```

## Writing a Skill

### Minimal skill

```markdown
---
name: greet
description: Print a greeting
---

Hello! How can I help you today?
```

### Full front matter reference

```yaml
---
# Required
name: skill-name # Unique identifier; used to invoke the skill
description: One-line description shown in the skill list

# Optional — conditional activation
paths:
  - 'src/**/*.rs' # Skill is only active when the working path matches

# Optional — context overrides applied when the skill runs
model: claude-sonnet-4-20250514 # Override the active model
effort: high # reasoning effort: low | medium | high
allowedTools: # Restrict which tools the skill may use
  - Read
  - Grep

# Optional — permission rules
permissions:
  allow:
    - 'ExecCommand(git *)'
  deny:
    - 'ExecCommand(rm *)'

# Optional — hooks registered when the skill is active
hooks:
  PreToolUse:
    - "echo 'about to run a tool'"
  PostToolUse:
    - "echo 'tool finished'"
  Stop:
    - "echo 'session ended'"

### Front matter fields

| Field               | Type     | Description                                                                   |
| ------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`              | string   | **Required.** Unique skill name.                                              |
| `description`       | string   | **Required.** Shown in system prompt skill list.                              |
| `paths`             | string[] | Glob patterns; skill is dormant unless the current path matches at least one. |
| `model`             | string   | Override active model for the duration of the skill.                          |
| `effort`            | string   | Override reasoning effort: `low`, `medium`, or `high`.                        |
| `allowedTools`      | string[] | Restrict tools to this list when the skill is running.                        |
| `permissions.allow` | string[] | Tool patterns that are always allowed.                                        |
| `permissions.deny`  | string[] | Tool patterns that are always denied (highest priority).                      |
| `hooks.PreToolUse`  | string[] | Shell commands run before each tool call.                                     |
| `hooks.PostToolUse` | string[] | Shell commands run after each tool call.                                      |
| `hooks.Stop`        | string[] | Shell commands run when the session ends.                                     |

## Variable Substitution

Inside the skill body, the following variables are replaced at runtime:

| Variable              | Replaced with                                                     |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `$ARGUMENTS`          | The full argument string passed to the skill invocation           |
| `$0`                  | The skill name itself                                             |
| `${FOOLRS_SKILL_DIR}` | Absolute path to the directory containing this skill's `SKILL.md` |

Example:

```markdown
---
name: run-tests
description: Run tests for a specific module
---

Run the test suite for module: $ARGUMENTS

Working directory: ${FOOLRS_SKILL_DIR}
```

## Shell Command Expansion

Lines containing `` !`cmd` `` execute `cmd` in a shell and substitute the
output inline:

```markdown
---
name: git-status
description: Show current git status
---

Current branch: !`git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`

Recent commits:
!`git log --oneline -5`
```

## Conditional Activation

Skills with a `paths:` field are **dormant** by default and become **active**
only when the current working path matches one of the glob patterns:

```yaml
---
name: rust-review
description: Rust-specific code review checklist
paths:
  - '**/*.rs'
  - 'Cargo.toml'
---
When reviewing Rust code, check:
  - No unwrap() in library code
  - Error types implement std::error::Error
  - Public APIs have doc comments
```

The skill appears in the system prompt only when a `.rs` file or `Cargo.toml`
is in scope.

## MCP Skills

Skills can also be loaded from MCP servers. MCP-sourced skills behave
identically to local skills with one restriction: **shell command expansion
(`` !`cmd` ``) is disabled** for MCP skills to prevent arbitrary code
execution from untrusted sources.

Configure MCP skill sources in the config file — see [mcp.md](mcp.md) for
server configuration.

## Bundled Skills

A small set of skills is compiled into the binary. Bundled skills:

- Are always available regardless of the filesystem skill directories
- Are **never truncated** by the prompt budget (they survive even when the
  skill list is shortened to stay within token limits)
- Cannot be overridden by a user skill with the same name

## Prompt Budget

When the total size of all skill descriptions exceeds the prompt budget, the
agent truncates the non-bundled skill list. Bundled skills are always
preserved. To stay within budget, keep skill descriptions concise.

## Troubleshooting

Use `foolrs skills path` to see which directories are being scanned and whether
they exist on disk:

```
$ foolrs skills path
User:    ~/Library/Application Support/foolrs/skills  (exists)
Project: /path/to/repo/.foolrs/skills                 (exists)
Legacy:  /path/to/repo/.foolrs/commands                (not found)
```
