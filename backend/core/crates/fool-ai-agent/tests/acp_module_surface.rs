//! Compile-only smoke test for `manager::acp` public surface.
//!
//! During the Stage 1 refactor (splitting `manager/acp/agent.rs` into smaller
//! submodules), this file pins the set of type names that must remain
//! reachable through `fool_ai_agent::manager::acp`. It proves nothing about
//! behaviour — only that the rename/move did not accidentally drop a public
//! export. Behavioural correctness is guarded by the byte-level diff of the
//! moved function bodies and by the stage's new targeted tests.
