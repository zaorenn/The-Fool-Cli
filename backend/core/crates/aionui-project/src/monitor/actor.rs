//! The monitor actor — a single sequential worker owning the runtime [`Shard`].
//!
//! Desktop runs one actor (N = 1): it owns the shard (tree + subscriptions),
//! the debounce buffer, and the `file:` runtime, and drives every state change
//! serially. Its event loop multiplexes four sources — inbound WS frames,
//! watcher raw events, the debounce-flush timer, and the grace-reap timer — so
//! the stage-0 pure cores (`Shard::handle` / `Debouncer` / `raw_to_command`)
//! run against a real clock without any timers living in their unit tests.
//!
//! Request dispatch (initialize / fs commands) lives in [`super::dispatch`].
