# Architecture

## Multi-Process Model

AionUi is an Electron app with three types of processes:

- **Main Process** (`src/process/`, `src/index.ts`) — application logic, database, IPC handling. No DOM APIs available.
- **Renderer Process** (`src/renderer/`) — React UI. No Node.js APIs available.
- **Worker Processes** (`src/process/worker/`) — background AI tasks (gemini, codex, acp workers).

Cross-process communication must go through the IPC bridge.

## IPC Communication

- Preload script: `src/preload.ts` — exposes a secure `contextBridge` API to the renderer
- Message type definitions: `src/renderer/messages/`
- All IPC channels are typed; add new channels in both the preload and the messages directory

## WebUI Server

Located in `src/process/webserver/`.

- Express + WebSocket for real-time communication
- JWT authentication for remote access
- Enables network clients to access the agent UI remotely (not just local Electron window)

## Cron System

Located in `src/process/services/cron/`.

- Based on `croner` library
- `CronService`: task scheduling engine
- `CronBusyGuard`: prevents concurrent execution of the same job
